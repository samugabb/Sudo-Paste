# Sudo-Paste 

formerly known as *TextReplicator*

This simple application is made for when you have to copy and paste a long string, but the receiving part does not accept pasting.
For example, if you have to input a very complex password into a remote machine and Clipboard Sharing is not enabled for security reasons.

- Focus the window/program in which you want to paste the text
- The program will show a 3 second timer (as icons in the SysTray) and then write the text back as keyboard input, followed by an "ENTER" KeyPress

# Options
There are just a couple options:
- You can choose to not simulate the ENTER KeyPress when the text has been pasted, by right-clicking the SysTray icon and using the corresponding menu option
- You can also choose to start Sudo-Paste automatically at windows logon, bu right-clicking the SysTray icon and using the corresponding menu option
